# Refuses a release tag that is not a signed statement, by a listed signer,
# about the commit being released under the name it was pushed as.
#
# The version of a release exists only in its tag, so the tag has to be a
# statement by a person holding a key rather than a label anyone with write
# access can move. Run in a checkout of the pushed tag:
#
#   GITHUB_REF_NAME   the tag that was pushed, v1.4.0
#   GITHUB_SHA        the commit the push event is about
#   ALLOWED_SIGNERS   the SSH keys that may sign a release, in the format of
#                     git's gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile, from the
#                     RELEASE_ALLOWED_SIGNERS repository variable
#   ALLOWED_PGP_KEYS  the OpenPGP keys that may sign a release, their public
#                     keys ASCII armored, from the RELEASE_ALLOWED_PGP_KEYS
#                     repository variable
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT     optional; receives object= and commit=, the tag object
#                     and the commit that were verified.
#
# The keys come from repository variables and never from the checkout, which
# the tagged commit controls. Either list may be empty, not both.
#
# Every check fails closed: no listed key, a signature git cannot verify, and
# a signature by anyone else all stop the release.
